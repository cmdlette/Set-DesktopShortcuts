# Set_DesktopShortcuts
Set desktop shortcuts for the logged-on user.

This script uses a set of variables to look for and selectively copy shortcuts to the logged-on user's desktop. I originally wrote it to be run as a logon script from Group Policy. Additionally, if you use PDQ Deploy and/or PDQ Inventory, it can be run as a PowerShell step in a Deploy package, or as a remote command or tool in Inventory.

# What you need to do
Read and edit the script carefully before executing. You will need to fill in your environment's:

0. $shortcutN file names and extensions
1. Location of items to be copied

# Other notes
This script, as shared, is not signed.
